This research uses machine learning for the prediction of the energy storage performance of 1,085 plant biomass samples with 20 features such as the elemental content, physical, elemental, and processing parameters. Regression models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressor) indicated high predictive accuracy, yielding test RÂ² values of 0.890 and 0.893, respectively, for identifying non-linear relations between biomass properties and capacitance. For classification, ensemble methods (Stacking, Voting, and Blended) achieved up to 88.15% accuracy for classifying capacitiy in Low, Medium, and High classes. Feature Importance analysis revealed Ash content, Fixed Carbon, and Lignin percentage as key performance determinants. This research emphasizes the ability of ensemble learning in linking biomass properties with efficiency in the process of converting energy, providing an optimal platform for intelligent material choice and the process of optimization in green energies.
